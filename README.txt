Introduction
============
This package contains the Default Plone themes applied through Diazo. Both of 
them have sass files to generate variations (like in the olden days with DTML). 
You will have to have SASS and Compass installed. 

To apply any of these themes, in site setup:
  - Install "Diazo theme support" under Add-on
  - Select "(Unstyles)" as Default themes under Themes

    To apply the Classic Theme, in site setup:
    - Enable "Classic Theme (classic)" under Diazo themes

    To apply the Sunburst Theme, in site setup:
    - Enable "Sunburst Theme (sunburst)" under Diazo themes
